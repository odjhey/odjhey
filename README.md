#### Yoooow! call me [odee](https://odjhey.com). 
<!-- I'm also (and more active these days) in [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/odelon.pacalso). -->

Nothing special here, but feel free to hit me up (email,DM,etc) for gigs, im `odjhey` in most of the socials.

~~You can view some deployed junk here.~~

### Current Interests include (very volatile list)
- process orchestration/DAGs (temporalio, dagster)
- data exploration (jupyter/python/pandas)
- data transformations (dbt)
- game idea validations (lua with love2d)
    - im into turn-based, simulations, rougelikes/lites
    
### Current state of affairs
- web with "js/ts and friends" stack, back and front, 90% of what I do is written in these, would love to turn it down a little
- next prolly would be python (bc data), then lua (going to prolly gdscript in the future)
- would also want to do more with the BEAM and JVM, have to pick up some slack and touch more of these
